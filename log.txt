+ Adaptive ROI selection applied. 
    - changed KNN background subtractor to MOG2 algorithm
    - learning rate for the back sub is modified according to the resemblance of the backsubed mask.
    - if the two following frames have similar backsubed mask, then the learning rate is lowered.
    - This operation is done by bitwize_and method
    => this resulted much better ROI selection 
+ ROI function applied.
    - I think this does not improve the result a lot, but I just added.
    - After constructing the ROI_image_stream, user manually select the ROI of the video stream.
    - Any image processed into the 
# TODO
    - I don't know the exact algorithm of the MOG2. I setup the parameters with few trials and errors,
    but I should look into the original work to set the best parameters for my purpose.

# Problems
    * no adaptive ROI selection.
        => if background intensity changes in the middle of the video, ROI extractor totally lost.
        However, I have to use the whole video when I initially build the forground extractor.
        Becasue time to time the animal do not move during the initial seconds so animal fades out.
            => check the ROI position and apply adaptive learing rate according to the position difference?
    * Build manual label corrector.
