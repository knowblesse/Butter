# Main Goal
Find the position and the head direction of the animal

Using the pre-trained networks such as ResNet

# Method 1 : crunch raw image data into the network 
## Problems
- pre-trained networks has relatively small input image size
- although we can resize the image into this size, but the animal in the apparatus is too small
- and re plotting the predicted location from the small resized image is non-sense!
- ===> suspend the further experiment

# Method 2 : make an small ROI patch of the image

# Simple Note
Conv2DTranspose : Transposed convolution layer (deconvolution)
